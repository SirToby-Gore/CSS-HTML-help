# CSS-HTML-help

the idea of this was originally to help me as a little catalog of little bits to help one practice and learn to code in both front and backend development.
I had the idea at some point to turn it into a web page so that little css snip-its could bee seen and used.

# Pages:

## Web

This to help you with front end development on the web.

### Examples

The idea of this page is to allow you to look at examples of some little css examples that look fancy to impress people and get hot chicks.

## Flutter

this has a handful of a link(s) to some flutter examples and helpful sheets.

## Coding practice

does what it says on the tin, it has a link to some coding practice sites.
